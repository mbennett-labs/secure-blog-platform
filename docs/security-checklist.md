- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add protection against XSS attacks
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] X-XSS-Protection header
- [ ] Protect against SQL injection
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (no sensitive data in errors)

### API Security
- [ ] Implement proper API authentication (JWT)
- [ ] Use short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API calls

## Content Security

### User-Generated Content
- [ ] Sanitize all user-generated content
