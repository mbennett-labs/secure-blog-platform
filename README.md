# Secure Blog Platform

A secure, modern blogging platform built with Node.js, Next.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a security-focused approach to building a modern web application, featuring:

- Secure authentication system with JWT and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- CI/CD integration

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx, Ubuntu

## Security Features

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- HTTPS enforcement
- Protection against XSS, CSRF, SQL injection

## Architecture

The application follows a modern architecture with:

- Containerized microservices
- Separation of frontend and backend
- Database abstraction through ORM
- Reverse proxy for security and performance

## Implementation

This project can be deployed on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) with:

1. Initial server setup and hardening
2. Docker and Docker Compose deployment
3. Nginx configuration for reverse proxy and SSL
4. Database setup with proper security measures
